A simple yet powerful way to visualizer 4xdat trades.

Notes:
Make sure the CSV file is not aggregated as a spredsheet (see the attached example file).

To start, simply drag the script on an appropiate chart in MetaTrader4 and enter the file name.

File retrieved from 4xdat MUST be placed in the \..\MQL4\Files directory
