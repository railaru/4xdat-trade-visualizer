A simple yet powerful way to visualize 4xdat trades using the MetaTrader4 platform.

Notes:
Make sure the CSV file is not aggregated as a spreadsheet (see the attached example file).

To start, simply drag the script on an appropiate chart in MetaTrader4 and enter the file name.

File retrieved from 4xdat MUST be placed in the \..\MQL4\Files directory
